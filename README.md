# rd boosters... 2!

this time around it's just going to be json. yaml was kinda
annoying tbh

like before, this is meant to accompany the setlists and not be
a replacement for them. 

# what are they going to look like?

 - no more dynamic boosters, boosters have a single set list.
 - boosters are "maps" - you specify a background image and where
   you want to place level icons on that background image.
 - the player can click and drag around the map, and click on
   level icons, which brings up the standard level box
 - the booster can also specify the player's "starting location",
 - we save the player's progress through the booster.

Essentially, the structure of the booster is determined by the
background image and what text is on it.
